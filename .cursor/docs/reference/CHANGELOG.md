**A**: 
1. **Higher Conversion**: Parents convert at 2-3x rate (15-20% vs. 8-12%)
2. **Higher Lifetime Value**: Kids stay 3-5 years vs. adults 1-2 years
3. **Family Opportunities**: Often leads to parent enrollment + sibling enrollments
4. **Less Competition**: "kids BJJ San Diego" easier to rank than "BJJ San Diego"
5. **Year-Round Stability**: Kids programs less seasonal than adult programs
6. **Word-of-Mouth**: Parents are excellent referrers to other parents
7. **Revenue Impact**: Could generate $20-30K additional annual revenue alone
