## 🎓 Key Principles

### 1. Performance is Non-Negotiable
Every feature must maintain sub-2-second load times

### 2. Mobile-First Always
60-70% of traffic will be mobile - optimize accordingly

### 3. Conversion Over Beauty
Aesthetic serves conversion, not the other way around

### 4. Data-Driven Decisions
Use analytics to optimize continuously, not gut feel

### 5. Community = Retention
Dashboard features pay dividends in retention

### 6. Content is SEO
Launch-day content strategy is not optional

### 7. One-Tap Mobile Actions
Make it trivially easy for mobile users to contact

### 8. Exit-Intent = 10-15% More Leads
Always give visitors a second chance to convert
